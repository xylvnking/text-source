# Portfolio Concepting With GPT-4

this document is a conversation between a user and chat gpt where they are planning the user’s 3d game art portfolio. Currently they have come up with 3 projects designed to have a cohesive narrative which also provides the user an opportunity to showcase the wide range of skills required by employers. 

This document is chatgpt and I planning out the (mostly) narrative concepts for my 3D game art portfolio. The portfolio will be hosted on artstation, and must have a focused and easy to understand narrative.

I want to create three pieces to satisfy a few goals:

1. I want to demonstrate different abilities and skillsets:
    1. Stage 1 is set in a dense forested environment, so I can showcase my ability to create foliage, rocks, and general nature elements. 
    2. Stage 2 is set indoors, to focus more on attention to detail and props.
    3. Stage 3 is set on a city street after an attack on a military parade, where I’ll be showcasing my ability to create urban environments and destruction.
2. Creating a cohesive story allows me to get more mileage out of the assets I create. This is not a small undertaking, so any ways that I can optimize the process are welcomed.
3. I believe environmental story telling is amazing and want to demonstrate my ability to create and communicate stories through 3d game art.

I plant to document the entire process, but need to research how best to do that on artstation and present it first.

I plan to make a post for each environment with detailed breakdowns.

I plan to make posts highlighting specialized materials I create in substance.

I plan to make posts highlighting hero props, and then also posts breaking down filler props but not individually.

I plan to make posts also highlighting the technical art-esque systems I implement, such as foliage, procedural generation, destruction/debris, shaders, etc.

I’m starting by creating the narrative concept, and then moving on to composing the shots and designing the artstation posts so that I know exactly what I need to create since anything out of frame won’t be as important.

Remember, the narrative should be told through the environment and objects within it rather than explicit text. The viewer should be able to piece together what happened based on what they see. This will make the environments feel more immersive and engaging, and showcase your skills in environmental storytelling.

## Lighting

- Consider the lighting GREATLY while blocking out the compositions
- What time of day exactly do all of these take place in?
- Lighting plays a crucial role in creating atmosphere and guiding the viewer's eyes. You could use natural light to your advantage, such as sunlight filtering through the foliage or reflecting off rocks and water bodies. The way the light hits the scene can guide the viewer's eyes to the key elements of your scene.

- General notes and ideas which I’ve most likely decided not to implement, but want to collect:
    - This approach can demonstrate your ability to maintain a consistent art style and thematic coherence across different environments and models. It also shows your capacity to think in terms of larger projects, which is a valuable skill when working in the game industry.
    - Worldbuilding: Include some information about the world you've created. This could be its history, the various factions or groups within it, the geography, etc. This can make your portfolio more engaging and show your storytelling ability.
    - Also, consider the ethical implications of the scenes you're portraying. While a public execution might fit the narrative you're crafting, it's also a violent and potentially controversial subject matter. Be mindful of how such imagery might be perceived by potential employers. They may be concerned about how it reflects on your judgment or your consideration of your audience. It might be worth considering alternative ways to convey the consequences of the soldiers' actions that don't involve explicit violence. Avoiding excessively violent or controversial themes doesn't mean the narrative needs to be any less impactful or engaging. In fact, it can often lead to more creative and nuanced storytelling.
    - Rather than a public execution, perhaps the scene could be a deserted urban area, where signs of a hurried escape or conflict are evident. The soldiers' truck could be left in a state of disarray, perhaps crashed or abandoned. Evidence of a conflict, like scattered personal items, bullet casings, or signs of a struggle, could suggest a dramatic event without showing it explicitly.
    - The scene could be the aftermath of a law enforcement raid on a location where the soldiers were based or a place they frequented. This could include police tape, signs of a struggle, or other evidence of law enforcement involvement.
    - Hidden Lab: The soldiers are collecting a shipment from a hidden laboratory nestled in the forest, where illegal substances are created. This could showcase your ability to blend natural and man-made elements.
    - Underground Market: The shipment has been moved to an underground black market in the city, a labyrinth of stalls and shops where all kinds of illegal items are traded. This allows for the creation of a richly detailed urban environment, with a variety of props and textures.
    - Military Base Attack Aftermath: The scene depicts the aftermath of an attack on a military base or outpost in the city. The street outside the base is filled with signs of the attack - debris, damaged vehicles, and graffiti could all be part of the scene. The base itself could show signs of damage, showcasing your skills in creating detailed, realistic urban environments.
    - Checkpoint Ambush: The criminals have ambushed a military checkpoint in the city. The scene could be strewn with discarded weapons, rubble from the attack, and remnants of the checkpoint. Graffiti and city clutter would add to the urban atmosphere of the scene.
    - Convoy Assault: The criminals have used the stolen ordinance to assault a military convoy moving through the city. The scene could show the aftermath of the assault, with damaged vehicles, debris, and signs of conflict in the surrounding urban environment.
    - Tech Expo: The city could be hosting a tech expo where various companies showcase their latest inventions. The scene could include futuristic tech stalls, holographic advertisements, and advanced robotics damaged by the explosion.
    - Cybernetic Parade: A parade showcasing the latest advancements in cybernetics and artificial intelligence could be the event that draws a crowd. The aftermath could include damaged androids and cybernetic parts scattered about.
    - Digital Protests: The explosion could occur during a large-scale protest against a powerful tech corporation or government surveillance. This could add layers to the narrative, suggesting a more complex motive behind the attack.
    - Virtual Reality (VR) Concert: The city could be hosting a massive VR concert where the attendees plug into a shared digital experience. The explosion happens in the physical world, but the remnants of VR equipment and digital interfaces could be part of the scene.
    - Underground Tech Expo: Instead of a mainstream event, the expo could be an underground gathering for outlawed tech. This would give the event a more gritty and rebellious feel, and could suggest that the thieves and their targets operate outside the law.

    - ideas about secret meeting places
        1. **Rest Stop:** Rest stops along highways are designed for drivers to take breaks. The truck could stop at one of these for a "rest," providing a window for the meeting.
        2. **Fueling Station:** Stopping for fuel is expected in any journey. A less busy station, perhaps one a little out of the way, could provide an opportunity for the meeting.
        3. **Maintenance/Inspection Station:** If the truck is military, stopping at a maintenance or inspection station wouldn't raise suspicion. If the meeting is brief, it could occur during the supposed inspection.
        4. **Loading/Unloading Zone:** If the truck's apparent purpose is to transport goods, stopping to load or unload would be normal. This could happen at a warehouse, storage facility, or other commercial destination.
        5. **Military Base/Checkpoint:** If the meeting could be arranged with someone stationed at a military base or checkpoint, the truck could stop there without arousing suspicion.
        6. **Border Crossing:** If the route includes crossing a national or state border, the truck would have to stop at the border. The wait could provide time for a meeting.
        7. **Ferry Crossing:** If the route includes a body of water that's typically crossed by ferry, the time waiting for and riding the ferry could provide cover for a meeting.
        8. **tealth Mode:** The truck could be equipped with a futuristic "stealth mode" that makes it temporarily invisible or less noticeable to tracking systems. This could be explained as a glitch or interference in the GPS system.
        9. **Holographic Decoy:** Advanced technology could project a hologram of the truck continuing on its route, while the real truck stops for the meeting. The hologram could also project an image of the truck appearing to be parked in a normal, non-suspicious location.
        10. **GPS Spoofing:** In this scenario, the truck's GPS signal is manipulated to make it appear as though it's following its expected route, when it's actually somewhere else. This could be done through hacking or some kind of signal-jamming device.
        11. **Underground Travel:** The truck could enter a hidden underground tunnel that runs parallel to its overground route. The GPS would show it moving along its route, but it would actually be below ground, where the meeting could take place.
        12. **Drone Meeting:** The meeting happens remotely. A drone flies out from the truck while it continues its route. The drone carries a secure communication device for the meeting.
    - cyberpunk truck description
        
        Sure, here's a description of a cyberpunk truck:
        
        The cyberpunk truck is a marvel of futuristic design and technology, blending the gritty aesthetic of the cyberpunk genre with the rugged functionality of a traditional truck. Its exterior is a sleek, matte black, adorned with neon accents that glow in the dark, illuminating the streets with a vibrant array of colors. The truck's body is armored with a high-tech alloy, resistant to both physical damage and cyber attacks.
        
        The front grille is replaced with a digital display, capable of showcasing a variety of symbols or messages. The headlights are high-intensity LEDs, their piercing light cutting through the densest fog or darkest night. The wheels are reinforced with a shock-absorbing material, allowing the truck to traverse the roughest terrains with ease.
        
        Inside, the truck is a haven of advanced technology. The dashboard is a holographic display, providing real-time data on the vehicle's status and the surrounding environment. The seats are made of a synthetic material that molds to the occupant's body, providing unparalleled comfort during long drives. The truck is also equipped with an advanced AI system, capable of autonomous driving and real-time threat assessment.
        
        The truck's bed is modular, capable of being reconfigured for a variety of tasks. It can serve as a cargo hold, a mobile workshop, or even a battle station, equipped with drone launchers and a retractable turret. The truck is powered by a hybrid engine, combining traditional combustion with advanced electric technology, providing both power and efficiency.
        
        In essence, the cyberpunk truck is a vehicle designed for the challenges of a dystopian future, combining advanced technology with a rugged design to create a vehicle that is as stylish as it is functional.
        

## Stage1

Foliage, rocks, nature, trees, 

- Consider adding details that suggest the clandestine activities taking place, such as a hidden path leading to the compound, or lookout posts hidden among the trees. perhaps some concealed huts or lookout points, or some sort of emblem or insignia that belongs to them.
- a road deep in the woods
- Maybe hooks attached to the truck , some way of showing how they actually stopped it. a fallen tree, a pile of dirt on a downhill (trucks can’t brake well if at all)
- Incorporating wildlife, like birds in the trees or small creatures on the forest floor, could add more life to your scene. It would also allow you to showcase your ability to create diverse models.
- Subtle environmental storytelling can add depth to the narrative. Maybe there are footprints leading up to the meeting spot, or discarded food wrappers indicating that the soldiers have been waiting for a while.
- makeshift camouflage, or the faint glow of a campfire in the distance.
- if I could do characters I’d have the thieves stealing their clothes
- chokepoint with a tree that falls down that has the thieves logo spray-painted onto it, and lots of thieves with guns pointed at the truck, clearly hijacking them

## Stage2

- cargo, tools, or personal items that might belong to the criminals.
- As the weapons are being loaded into the vehicle, you could draw attention to it with lighting, positioning, or by placing it in the center of the composition.
- Add various elements to make the warehouse look used and lived-in: tools, discarded packaging, crates, old furniture, etc. These elements can also help tell the story of the criminals' operation.
- Lighting and Shadows: Use lighting to highlight important parts of the scene, like the distinctive vehicle or the weapons. You could also use shadows to add depth and create a sense of mystery or foreboding.
- Use of Perspective: Consider using a perspective that shows both the inside of the warehouse and the exterior environment. This would allow you to showcase your ability to create both interior and exterior environments. such as a skylight
- The vehicle could have unique details that make it instantly recognizable in the third stage. It could be a specific color, have a unique decal, or even a distinctive dent or scratch.
- Captivity in the Warehouse: The warehouse could be filled with various objects that tell the story of the soldiers' captivity. This could include things like the soldiers' personal belongings, pictures of their families as you mentioned, and maybe even some sort of makeshift calendar or tally marks that show the passage of time. The storyboard showcasing plans for stage 3 is a great idea - it could be done in the form of a map or blueprint with annotations, or perhaps some sort of 3D model or mockup.
- . The hideout/garage could be filled with objects that hint at their plans, like maps, weapons, and contraband. A planning board with photos and notes could serve as a central piece that ties the narrative together. Other elements could include tools for rigging the truck with explosives and personal items that give some insight into the thieves' lives.
- Rigging the Truck: The garage could be filled with signs of the thieves' activities, such as tools used to rig the truck, blueprints or schematics of the truck (which could also serve as a showcase of your modeling work), and maybe some discarded food or drink that suggests the thieves have been living here while they work.
- rigging with explosives
- The garage is dimly lit, filled with shadows and echoing with the quiet hum of a fluorescent light. Tools, old car parts, and other typical garage clutter are scattered around, suggesting a space that is frequently used but rarely organized.

## Stage3

- Burnt out vehicles
- This scene will showcase your skills in creating urban environments and your ability to handle complex and large-scale scenes.
- The key event is the moment just after the explosion, with the scene in chaos.
- Scatter weapons similar to those from the second stage around the scene. If they're unique or distinctive in some way, they can serve as a visual cue that links back to the earlier stages.
- Include discarded or damaged military uniforms that match those worn by the soldiers in the first stage. This could show the viewer that the soldiers were part of the convoy or parade that was attacked.
- Use graffiti to hint at the narrative. This could be something as direct as anti-military slogans, or it could be more subtle, perhaps a symbol or logo associated with the criminals.
- Consider including signs or banners indicating that a parade or convoy was taking place. This could be as simple as banners with well-wishes for the soldiers, or official signage indicating the route of the convoy.
- If the city environment includes digital billboards or displays, these could be used to communicate additional information. For example, a news ticker could reference the attack, or a public safety announcement could advise citizens to avoid the area.
- the direction of the debris and damage could suggest the direction of the attack, and the position of the vehicles and bodies could suggest how the events unfolded.
- If the criminals have a distinctive logo or symbol, you could incorporate it into the scene - perhaps it's spray-painted onto a wall or displayed on a discarded piece of clothing or equipment. This could indicate that the criminals were responsible for the attack.
- To make it clear that this is the same vehicle from stage 2, you could include some of its distinctive features in the wreckage. For example, if the vehicle had a unique logo or color, you could include that in the debris.
- evidence of a rapid evacuation (overturned objects, abandoned items).
- street signs, traffic lights, fire hydrants, benches, trash cans, etc. Graffiti could also be included to add color and character to the scene.
- The vehicle could be in a state of destruction, perhaps even the epicenter of the blast, creating a powerful visual link between the stages.
- The environment should also clearly show that this is a 'protected' area - perhaps there are high security fences, security cameras, or special signage.
- Digital Billboards/News Tickers: You could include billboards or news tickers that are displaying breaking news about the incident. This could be a dynamic way to provide narrative information.
- Debris scattered around, damaged vehicles, and chaos among the crowd would provide a strong contrast to the order and discipline of the military display.
- 
- these are all cool ways chat came up with for the thieves to claim responsibility:
    
    Thieves' Message: Perhaps there could be some way for the thieves to claim responsibility that ties into the parade - maybe they hack into the large screens to display their message, or drop leaflets from a drone.
    
    Hacked Screens: The thieves could have hacked into the screens displaying the parade. After the explosion, these screens could be displaying their message, potentially even including their logo or symbol. This would be a very public way of claiming responsibility and spreading their message.
    
    Graffiti: If the thieves have a distinct symbol or logo, they could have sprayed it onto buildings, vehicles, or other surfaces at the scene of the explosion. This could be a more subtle way of claiming responsibility, and would add an extra layer of detail to the environment.
    
    Leaflets from a Drone: The thieves could use a drone to drop leaflets over the scene after the explosion. These leaflets could contain their message, and possibly even an explanation of their motives. This would be a very dramatic way of claiming responsibility.
    
    Holographic Projection: If the city has the technology, the thieves could have hacked into a system to project a holographic message into the air above the scene. This would be a very futuristic way of claiming responsibility, and would be visually striking.
    
    Radio Broadcast: The thieves could have taken over the city's public broadcast system to send out their message. This would not be visually represented in the scene, but could be implied through props like radios or PA systems.
    
    Augmented Reality Graffiti: In a truly cyberpunk twist, the thieves could leave their mark in the form of AR graffiti. Viewers with the right tech (AR glasses, for example) could see the thieves' message superimposed on the real world. This could be represented in your scene with a few characters reacting to something unseen by others.
    
    Digital Billboard Hack: Large digital billboards around the city could be hacked to display the thieves' message, allowing them to claim responsibility and spread their message on a large scale. This could create a surreal and dystopian atmosphere, especially if the billboards were displaying cheerful advertisements or propaganda before the hack.
